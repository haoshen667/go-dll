# go-dll
If you need to call methods of a DLL in go, go-dll provide several methods to convert args between go and C.

Note that some methods of go-dll may not have sufficient conditions to test, so if you encounter problem, just be calm and search it.

The code comes from the net and chatgpt, thanks.
